# Amazon E2E Testing Project

This project is designed to perform end-to-end testing on the Amazon website using Playwright and TypeScript. The tests are written to simulate user interactions such as searching for products, opening product details, adding items to the cart, and removing items from the cart.

## Project Structure

* `src/pages`: This directory contains page object models for the Amazon website. Each page object encapsulates the functionality and elements of a specific page on the website.
* `src/tests`: This directory contains the test files that use the page objects to perform end-to-end testing scenarios.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
3. Run the tests using `npx playwright test`.
